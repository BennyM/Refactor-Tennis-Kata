# Refactor-Tennis-Kata

Based on [Emily Bache's](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata) version, though the existing tests were not copied over. A console application has been added that hosts a game.

## Outline
We want to improve the existing code but have no safety net. The first step will be to introduce a golden master so we can start refactoring the code, adding tests along the way.
